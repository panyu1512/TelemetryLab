# Design — TelemetryLab

A locked design system for this app. Every surface redesign reads this file
before emitting code. Do not regenerate it per screen — extend or amend it when
the system needs to grow.

Because this is one product rather than a set of pages, the usual "make each
page different" rule is **inverted**: surfaces must share the system. Variety
lives in what each surface *does*, not in its palette or its type.

## Genre

**modern-minimal** — the technical, instrument-panel end of it. Dark by
necessity: overlays are composited over live game footage, and the manager sits
on a second monitor at night.

## Audience and use case

Sim racers, mid-session. The Overlay Manager is nominally a pre-race surface,
but it gets opened alt-tabbed or on a second screen between stints. The design
target is therefore: **state readable without reading**, primary action always
reachable, nothing that costs the user a corner.

Tone: **technical**. Instrument nomenclature, hairline rules, dense data, no
decoration.

## Macrostructure family

- **App surfaces: Workbench.** A left rail of subjects, a fixed-width control
  column, and a live preview taking the remaining space. The preview is the
  frame; the config column is its annotation. Variation knob: whether the
  preview pane exists (the Manager has it; Global Settings and Debug do not,
  and centre a single `max-w-3xl` column instead).
- **Overlay surfaces: none.** An overlay is a single widget card with a header
  rule and a body. It has no macrostructure and must never acquire one.

## Theme

Custom (tuned), anchored on the palette this project already had — converted to
OKLCH so a token can be lifted to hit a contrast target without dragging its
hue. Values in [`tokens.css`](tokens.css); the live source is the `@theme` block
in [`src/styles.css`](src/styles.css).

Four runtime themes (Carbon, Midnight, Graphite, Endurance) vary the temperature
of the neutrals and the exact accent hues. **They never vary what a colour
means.**

| Token | Meaning | Never used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--color-accent` | positive: personal best, faster, healthy | chrome, decoration |
| `--color-danger` | critical: slower, overheating, out of fuel | destructive-button chrome at rest |
| `--color-warning` | caution: pit soon, yellow flag, worn tyres | interactive affordances |
| `--color-primary` | interactive & informational: selection, links | telemetry values |
| `--color-sector-purple` | overall-best lap/sector | anything else |

Two rules that fall out of that table and are easy to break:

1. **`--color-on-accent` is the only text colour allowed on a filled status
   surface.** Every accent in this system is light and every paper is dark, so
   `white` on a filled accent measures 2.2–2.9:1. `on-accent` reads 6.5–8.7:1.
2. **A theme's `primary` must stay ≥30° in hue from its `warning`.** Endurance
   shipped them 8° apart, which made "you can click this" and "caution" the
   same colour.

## Typography

- **Display and body: Inter** (`--font-sans`), weights 400/500/600. A
  single-family system — this genre allows it, and a second display face on a
  panel this dense would be noise.
- **Mono** (`--font-mono`) is the third voice, and it is *semantic*, not
  stylistic. It marks **instrument nomenclature**: measured values, coordinates,
  counts, protocol versions, log lines, channel labels, status readouts.
- Prose — descriptions, hints, help text — is always sans. If a string is a
  sentence someone reads, it is sans. If it is a value or the name of a
  channel, it is mono.
- Numerals in any column or ticking value carry `.tnum`.
- Micro-labels are mono, uppercase, `tracking-[0.12em]`–`[0.14em]`, `text-faint`.
- **Headings are roman.** No italic display type anywhere.

## Spacing

Tailwind's default 4-point scale. Named equivalents are exported in
`tokens.css` for portability; the app uses the utilities.

## Motion

- Easings: `--ease-out` `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`, plus `--ease-in` and
  `--ease-in-out`. These override Tailwind's transition defaults, so a bare
  `transition-colors` inherits the curve without restating it.
- Durations: `--dur-instant` 80 ms, `--dur-short` 140 ms, `--dur-mid` 220 ms.
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only. Never layout properties.
- No overshoot or bounce on UI state.
- Reveal pattern: **none.** The manager fades in once on mount (`manager-in`).
  Nothing animates on scroll.
- Reduced motion: spatial movement collapses to ≤150 ms opacity; the two short
  durations go to 0.
- **The focus ring is never transitioned.** It appears on the frame the key
  lands.

## Microinteractions stance

- Silent success. No celebratory toasts — the panel shows the result.
- Optimistic change; the control *is* the confirmation.
- Hover tooltips delay 800 ms; focus tooltips 0 ms.
- Hover affordances always have a focus equivalent.

## Component contract

Every interactive element in [`src/components/ui/controls.tsx`](src/components/ui/controls.tsx)
ships all eight states: default · hover · `:focus-visible` · active · disabled ·
loading · error · success. Three invariants:

1. **`border-width` never changes between states.** State goes to background,
   outline or colour — never to geometry.
2. **The focus ring is an `outline` at 2 px offset**, so it lands on the page
   rather than the control's own fill and stays visible on a filled button.
3. **Pointer targets are expanded past the painted box** with an inset
   pseudo-element, so the panel stays dense without becoming fiddly.

Text inputs additionally reserve a right-edge slot for the spinner/status glyph
and a stable one-line helper row, so neither appearing reflows the panel.

## CTA voice

- Primary: `bg-primary` fill + `text-on-accent`, `--radius-ctl` (6 px), label
  is a verb phrase, always `whitespace-nowrap`.
- Secondary: `bg-surface-2` + 1 px `--color-border`, same geometry.
- Destructive: secondary geometry; `danger` arrives only on hover, never at
  rest.

## What every surface MUST share

- The token names (not the values — those move per theme).
- The colour *meanings* in the table above.
- Inter + mono, with mono reserved for instrument nomenclature.
- The control contract and the 8 states.
- 6 px controls / 10 px cards / 12 px panels.
- `.tnum` on every column of numbers.

## What surfaces MAY differ on

- Presence of the preview pane (Workbench with or without it).
- Density — an overlay over game footage is tighter than the manager.
- Which status colours appear at all; most surfaces use none.

## Per-surface allowances

- **Manager chrome** speaks the instrument voice: mono channel labels, the
  fading `.header-rule` as section divider, the three-state sidebar rail.
- **Overlay widgets** are legibility-first over footage: `overlay-card` glass,
  text-shadow, no scrollbars, no frame. They must never gain manager chrome.
- **No surface uses enrichment.** No hero imagery, no illustration, no
  decorative background beyond the existing `.bg-blueprint` dot grid on manager
  chrome. Function carries every screen.

## Known follow-ups

- The overlay widgets' own header labels are still sans; they were deliberately
  left out of the Manager redesign so the preview keeps showing overlays
  exactly as they render over the game. Aligning them to the mono nomenclature
  rule is a separate change that should be verified against real footage.
- `--color-danger` and `--color-warning` have no `-dim` counterpart, so a
  filled destructive button has no hover fill. Not needed yet: destructive
  actions here are outline-at-rest.
